The end goal is a website that emulates a property management system where users (dummy-data) can:

---------------------------
1. Register for Accounts
2. Login to Registered Accounts
3. Update Personal Information
4. Store, Retrieve, Update, and Delete Personal Inventories
5. Add Prices to Items in Inventory
6. Upload Pictures and Videos of Items in Inventory
7. Add Authorized Users to Manage Personal Inventories
8. More TBD
----------------------------

__UPDATE: Website was created and configured on Heroku's free hosting service(no longer available). All backend functionality will not work as currently configured.__ 
** Frontend functionality should be unchanged but may not behave as intended.
